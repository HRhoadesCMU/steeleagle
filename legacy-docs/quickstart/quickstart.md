# Quickstart
This guide will walk you through installing the SteelEagle software suite and running your first mission. All steps will assume deployment on the [Parrot Anafi](https://www.parrot.com/us/drones/anafi) which can be purchased on Amazon for less than $500. A physical drone is not necessary but must be used for Python or Java HITL simulation.

For your safety and the safety of those around you, the provided steps are for running a mission on a simulated drone. If you wish to run missions on a real drone, please read our First Flight guide after completing this tutorial.
