# Installation
Clone the SteelEagle [repository](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/steeleagle/tree/main) onto your computer and the server which will eventually run the backend. Then, on your smartphone, install Parrot FreeFlight 6 which is available on both the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freeflight-6/id1386165299) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parrot.freeflight6&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1). Next, decide on a control environment: Python (Onion) or Java (smartwatch). There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. Once you select the environment you want, follow the associated instructions below.
