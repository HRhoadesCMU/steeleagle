# Installation
Clone the SteelEagle [repository](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/steel-eagle/tree/main). Then, install the necessary SDK for your drone. In this case, we will be working with the [Parrot Anafi](https://www.parrot.com/us/drones/anafi) which uses [Parrot Olympe](https://developer.parrot.com/docs/olympe/installation.html) for Python control and [Parrot GroundSDK](https://developer.parrot.com/docs/groundsdk-android/index.html) for Java control. Follow the steps below to install either the Python or Java control environment.

## Python Environment
This section will describe how to configure the [Onion Omega 2 LTE](https://onion.io/store/omega2-lte-na/) to work with SteelEagle.

### Hardware Preparation
Insert a working compatible SIM card into your Onion Omega 2 LTE. Then, follow the steps outlined on Onion's [webstie](https://onion.io/omega2-lte-guide/) to complete setup. Ensure that your Onion has both WiFi and LTE working properly before proceeding.

Optionally, you may wish to use the provided SteelEagle [STL files](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/steel-eagle/tree/main/stl/) to print our custom harness for the Onion. Follow the instructions at

### Software Installation
First, install Parrot Olympe by [following the steps provided on Parrot's website](https://developer.parrot.com/docs/olympe/installation.html). Then, navigate to the root directory of the SteelEagle [repository](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/steel-eagle/tree/main).

### Verification

### Parrot GroundSDK
Parrot GroundSDK will be installed automatically when you build the control app on the Galaxy Watch. It is not necessary to build it separately.
