Introduction
------------
Today, commercial autonomous drones are used for increasingly demanding tasks, from building inspection to area surveillance, which require
computationally heavy algorithms. These algorithms necessitate the use of high-end CPUs and GPUs which are often mounted onboard the aircraft, driving up
cost and weight. With Steel Eagle, we propose a framework for autonomous drones that enables small, lightweight, and cheap drones to run these 
algorithms with similar performance to larger, more expensive drones using edge computing.
